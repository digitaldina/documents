# Preface
For now this is where @hurricos is dumping different lists of sites
and what they're up to. @hurricos intends in the long-run to create or
contribute to a Mediawiki-based wiki to act as an "index" or
"directory" for anyone to get anywhere in the space of community
network projects.

## How should they be organized?
Put things into markdown by category (think: Mediawiki-based
Categories, like at the bottom of the [Mediawiki page for
categories](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Categories))
